If you notice a problem with the web app that you believe needs improvement
but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a Github issue

the content and/or screenshots if applicable. Web app developers will review
issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

The web app developer will review your change and approve or comment on it in due
course.
